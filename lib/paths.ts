/**
 * Everything Signature owns lives under one directory. Back it up and you have
 * backed up the entire journal.
 *
 * Where that directory is depends on how the app was started:
 *
 *   - from source (`npm run desktop`, `npm run dev`) it is ./data
 *   - from a packaged build the Electron shell passes SIGNATURE_DATA_DIR, which
 *     points beside the executable — so a portable copy on a USB stick carries
 *     its own journal and writes nothing to the host machine.
 *
 * process.cwd() is not trustworthy in a packaged app, which is why this is
 * handed in rather than inferred.
