 * A half-written trade, kept until it is saved.

 * that to a stray refresh or a mis-hit Escape is exactly the friction that
 * makes a session go unlogged, and a journal only works if writing in it is
 * never risky.
 *
 * Drafts live in localStorage rather than the database on purpose: an unsaved
 * trade is not a trade, and it should never appear in a stat, a cluster or an
 * export. It also must never survive as a ghost — saving clears it.
