/**
 * Whose standard a piece of writing is held to.

 * The minimums went up. Applied naively that makes every trade written under
 * the old rule impossible to save again — open one to correct its P&L and the
 * app refuses until you have written seventy more characters about a trade
 * from three weeks ago. That is the app becoming a gatekeeper over its own
 * history, which is the one thing it must never be.
 *
 * So the floor applies to what you write, not to what is already on record.
 * Pass `previous` on an edit: text that is byte-identical to what is stored
 * passes at any length, and the moment you change it the current floor
 * applies. Pass `restoring` for an import — those rows were authored once
 * already, under whatever rule was in force then, and a backup that will not
 * restore is not a backup.
