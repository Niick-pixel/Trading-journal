-- A box that did not apply is not a box you failed.
--
-- The grade was a mark out of 100 with every one of the plan's weights always
-- on the table. But not every session offers every condition: if there is no
-- major level anywhere near price, "Clear sweep of a MAJOR level" is not a
-- rule I broke, it is a question the market did not ask. Scoring it as a miss
-- capped an otherwise flawless A setup at 80 and filed it as a B — and because
-- adherence reads the same threshold, the app then told me I had broken a rule
-- on a trade I had executed exactly as written.
--
-- The seven Phase 1 and Phase 2 boxes become tri-state: ticked, not ticked, or
-- NULL for "did not apply". The score is now the percentage of the points that
-- WERE on the table, so a day with no sweep available is graded out of 80.
--
-- The two Phase 3 boxes stay NOT NULL and cannot be marked N/A. Phase 3 is the
-- trigger: without the return to the FVG and the inversion close there is no
-- entry at all, so "it did not apply" is not a thing that can be true of a
-- trade that exists.
--
-- Nothing already recorded changes meaning or grade. Every existing row has a
-- real 0 or 1 in all nine boxes, so possible is 100 and the percentage equals
-- the old total exactly.
