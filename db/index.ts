/**
 * SQLite comes from `node:sqlite`, built into Node itself.
 *
 * This used to be better-sqlite3, which is a native C++ addon. That meant a
 * prebuilt binary had to exist for your exact platform and Node ABI — and when
 * one doesn't, npm silently falls back to compiling from source, which on
 * Windows demands a full Visual Studio C++ toolchain. Using the runtime's own
 * SQLite removes that entire class of problem: no compiler, no prebuild
 * roulette, no rebuild step when Electron updates, and nothing to package.
